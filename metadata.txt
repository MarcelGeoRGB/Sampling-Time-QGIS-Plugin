about=The "Sampling Time" plugin allows users to perform various sampling methods, including judgmental, random, systematic, stratified, and cluster sampling, on shapefile layers. It generates a shapefile with the coordinates of the sampled points, including labels and customizable symbology. Additionally, users can create sampling and exclusion zones, as well as stratified and cluster sampling areas.
